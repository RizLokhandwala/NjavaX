# NjavaX
This project is developed by:

-Riz Lokhandwala
-Glenn Turner
-Sean Nguyen

We will be creating a java equivalent of NginX. To do this we will be working in 2 week sprints.

## Running the Program

The program may be run by:
```NjavaX mode {1,2,3} portno {port number} config {config file name} landing {folder for landing page}```
All of these are optional
Defaults are:
- mode 0
- portno 8080 (this is listening port)
- config .\NjavaX.cnfg
- landing /tmp/webpagefiles
